## Preparing the javascript/node and show a window

Required files to be in place:
 - package.json - javascript ecosystem way to define dependencies.
   + needs to have the slint-ui version defined to
     be able to generate the scala.js bindings from the
     typescript definitions it provides.
     slint-ui is officially published on npm and since version
     1.4.0 provides the native binaries already packaged.
   + not exactly sure, but the other requirement is to have
     typescript compiler defined for the scala code generator
     to work properly

 - index.js - the "main" of the node/js ecosystem.
   This file is here just to make sure that in a pure javascript
   only project/demo we can properly bring in the slint library
   and see it working and showing a window.


With these setup in place we should be able to make the demo run.
Supposedly we can call something "node magic command" to make things
work, but node and npm world is too much of a bonkers world that I don't
want to spend time in going with it.

So, install "deno" from the package manager or something and run the following:

```
deno run --node-modules-dir -A index.js
```

And node_modules should be now generated with things inside and a
window that says slint should be shown.


## Generate the scala.js wrappers

 1. installs stc (https://scalablytyped.org/docs/cli) which is the tool
    that will read the javascript/typescript mess and generate scala code.

 2. run: `‚ùØ ~/.local/share/coursier/bin/stc slint-ui` which should generate
    code and put it in "out" folder.

## Let's try to use scala-cli to build this
 ...

Copied the generated code inside the out folder about slint/ui into
src/js.

There's another folder in the out called std which I have a VERY
HARD TIME understanding what it is about.

Overall the documentation regarding all these things is very very
lacking and assumes if you are messing with this things then you
clearly know what most of the terms being talked about are related
to, but if you are flying blind and messing in js/node ecosystem
for the first time then it's all gibberish.

Anyway.

Added a using directive to the files copied into the src/js folder
so that they only compile with when targetting scala.js.

It fails to compile and seems to need to add dependency for scalablytyped runtime.
There's no docs anywhere about this thing. Probably magic done by the sbt plugin??

oh well.

after adding that dep, it fails to compile because now wants the typings.std...
so it is needed after all? what even is it??? damn i hate everything

ok, generated again, changed the src/js folder to have different folders
for each slint/ui and std.

the runtime dep appears in the build.sbt file generated, that i have no idea if it's
supposed to use or not..

trying to compile again now there's errors about org.scala.dom,
so I guess the other dep is also needed.

also on the using dep, i was really convinved that I should be using ::: but
it seems to fail and actually works with :: ??? what

seems to be stuck now compiling everything...

it actually COMPILED with scala-cli compile .

!!


...

oh well forget it. it's all too hard.

putting this on hold and go follow the already known path and use sbt
and try with that.
